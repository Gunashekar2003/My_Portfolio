            <p><strong>A "Java full stack" refers to a type of software development technique that involves using the Java programming language for both the front-end and back-end parts of a web application. In easy-to-understand terms, it means that Java is used to create both the parts of a website that you see and interact with (like buttons and forms) and the parts that work behind the scenes to store data, process requests, and make the website function properly.</strong></p>

                      <dd>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</dd>

                         <dd> A deep understanding of Java fundamentals is essential to becoming a full stack developer. Having a strong grasp of Java’s core concepts, such as classes, inheritance, abstraction, etc., is crucial for developing full stack applications running on the web or mobile platforms.</dd>

                         <dd>Frameworks are pre-written and thoroughly tested collections of code, classes, components, templates, and other structures that you can utilize to streamline the development process of applications. One particularly renowned framework is the Java Spring framework, celebrated for simplifying the web development process for small-scale and enterprise-level Java applications.</dd>

                          <dd>MySQL  is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). Its name is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter My, and "SQL", the acronym for Structured Query Language. A relational database organizes data into one or more data tables in which data may be related to each other; these relations help structure the data. SQL is a language that programmers use to create, modify and extract data from the relational database, as well as control user access to the database. In addition to relational databases and SQL, an RDBMS like MySQL works with an operating system to implement a relational database in a computer's storage system, manages users, allows for network access and facilitates testing database integrity and creation of backups.</dd>
